The Bouncy Duck game is an adaptation of the classic bounce game, 
where you should help Bouncy the duck to reach its home facing enemies

duck should jump on. As for the user interface there are several menus such 
as start and exit menu (etc.â€¦). Software module includes controllers for the 
player, enemies moving tiles and structure for user interface.
